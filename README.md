# Recursion and Merge Sort Practice

## Assignment 1: Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence, a mathematical sequence in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, is an excellent problem to illustrate recursion.

### Task 1: Iterative Solution
I will start by writing an iterative function called `fibs` that takes an integer as input and returns an array containing that many numbers from the Fibonacci sequence.

### Task 2: Recursive Solution
Next, i will tackle the same problem but from a recursive perspective. Implement a function named `fibsRec` to compute the Fibonacci sequence recursively.

## Assignment 2: Merge Sort

Sorting algorithms provide valuable insights into the power of recursion, and Merge Sort is an excellent example of this.
The goal of this assignment is to build a function, `mergeSort`, which sorts an input array using the recursive merge sort methodology.
