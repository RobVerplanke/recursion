# Learning Recursion and Merge Sort

## Introduction
This repository contains assignments and code specifically designed for self-study and practice, helping me strengthen my understanding of these fundamental concepts in computer science and programming.

## Purpose
The assignments and code in this repository are intended to serve as a learning resource, providing practical exercises to deepen my knowledge and skills.

## About The Odin Project
These assignments are part of The Odin Project, a comprehensive and open-source curriculum designed to help individuals learn web development, including essential computer science topics like algorithms and data structures.

## Assignment 1: Fibonacci
In Assignment 1, I'll be working on the Fibonacci sequence, a classic problem often used to illustrate recursion. The task involves implementing both iterative and recursive solutions to generate Fibonacci numbers. This exercise will help me appreciate the power of recursion in solving problems.

## Assignment 2: Merge Sort
Assignment 2 delves into the Merge Sort algorithm, a highly efficient sorting technique that leverages the principles of recursion. Here, I'll build a function to perform a recursive merge sort on an input array, gaining insights into how recursion can be applied to real-world problem-solving.
